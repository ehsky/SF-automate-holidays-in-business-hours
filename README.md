## OBS: Work in progress
**This repo is work in progress.** \
There is one issue that needs to be fixed first before the example flow can be used. \
The example flow will create the holiday records and find the default Business hour config, but will not assosicate the holiday records with business hour config. \
Check out the salesforce ide here https://ideas.salesforce.com/s/idea/a0B8W00000GddBHUAZ/expose-junction-between-business-hours-and-holidays

A potential workarround could be to include a minified version of [apex-mdapi](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi) that can deploy the metadata type [BusinessHoursSettings](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.236.0.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_businesshourssettings.htm).

By default the scheduled flow is run every week and checking if current date is new year's day. \
